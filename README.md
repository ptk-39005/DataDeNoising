# Abstract
<p>
The point of this project is applying Fast Fourier Transform algorithm that converts a signal from its time domain to a representation in frequency domain and thus implementing the same 
to exterminate noises from our dataset.<p/p>

# Description

# DataDenoiser -The project commences with the creation of a simple dataset, which is a summation of two sinusodial waves of different frequencies and introducing noise to that dataset. Thereafter 
we used the Fast Fourier Transform to pull out the structure,data and the noise. (The fourier analysis converts a signal from its time domain into frequency domain and vice versa). Following 
this we killed all the frequencies whose power was less than a specific threshold, consequently obtaining a clean dataset without any noises.
