# Abstract
<p>
The point of this project is applying Fast Fourier Transform algorithm that converts a signal from its time domain to a representation in frequency domain and thus implementing the same 
to exterminate noises from our dataset.

# Description

# DataDenoiser
  The project commenced with the creation of a simple dataset, which is a summation of two sinusoidal waves of different frequencies and noise was introduced to that dataset. Thereafter the Fast Fourier Transform was used to pull out the structure, data and the noise. The signal was converted from its time domain to frequency domain and vice versa using Fourier analysis. Followingly, all the frequencies whose power was less than a specific threshold were detached, consequently obtaining a clean dataset without any noises.
